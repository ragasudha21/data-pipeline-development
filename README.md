DOMAIN:FRONT END DEVELOPMENT(DATA SCIENCE)
MENTOR:NEELA SANTHOSH
DESCIPTION:
Used tools such as Pandas and Scikit-learn to perform these tasks.
The first task of the CodTech Data Science Internship focuses on building a data pipeline — a fundamental component in any data science or machine learning project. The goal of this task is to create a seamless and efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using popular Python libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn. This task serves as a practical introduction to handling real-world data workflows and preparing data for analytics or predictive modeling.

In this task, interns are expected to simulate or work with a dataset to extract the raw data, clean and preprocess it, transform it into a usable format, and finally load it into a target structure for further analysis or model training. Data preprocessing may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical data, scaling features, removing outliers, and converting formats. Transformation steps could include feature engineering, normalization, or dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance the quality of the dataset. These steps are vital in ensuring that the downstream models trained on this data perform optimally.

Interns will utilize Pandas, a robust data manipulation library in Python, to perform data wrangling operations efficiently. Scikit-learn, a powerful machine learning library, will aid in implementing transformations such as encoding, scaling, and splitting data for training and testing purposes. By combining these tools, students will gain hands-on experience in real-world data handling and understand how clean and structured data can significantly impact the success of data models.

The deliverable for this task is a Python script or a Jupyter Notebook that automates the entire ETL process. The code should be well-commented, modular, and easy to understand. Emphasis should be placed on writing reusable functions and ensuring that the pipeline can be applied to similar datasets with minimal adjustments. Interns are also encouraged to upload their scripts to GitHub to demonstrate version control and collaborative workflow practices, which are essential in professional data science projects.

This task reinforces the intern’s understanding of the data pipeline concept and prepares them for more complex data engineering and modeling challenges in the later stages of the internship. By completing this task, participants will improve their programming, data wrangling, and logical thinking skills, which are critical for any aspiring data scientist or analyst.

In summary, Task 1 is designed to equip interns with the foundational skills to build data pipelines, a crucial step in any data-driven project. The focus on automation, code clarity, and use of industry-
standard libraries ensures that interns are working in alignment with best practices used by professionals. Successfully completing this task will not only contribute to the intern's technical portfolio but also fulfill an essential milestone in the CodTech internship program, culminating in a completion certificate upon finishing all required tasks.
